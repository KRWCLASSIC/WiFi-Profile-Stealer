# WiFi Profile Stealer
Takes WiFi profiles from the computer and saves them in 2 places, to a massive .csv file and into a folder with a WiFi profile dumped into its text file.

# Running
You can use my [Portable Python](https://github.com/KRWCLASSIC/Portable-Python-3.11.7) to run this on a USB drive on a public computer. Nothing more is required but it's recommended to create a .bat script to make it faster to execute.
